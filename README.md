Basic Website

	This website was created by me using the book "HTML & CSS" by the author Jon Duckett where I was thought some useful knowledge by writing in most if not all the examples/information taught in the book. For example I learned about tags, attributes, positioning, fonts, tables, lists, inserting media onto a page, and much more. I'm ocassionally updating this website to make it more interactive by finish reading his JavaScript book. I am willing to have people contribute to this project with some recommendations and own contributions because there is always room for improvements and I would love for others to be part of my learning Journey
