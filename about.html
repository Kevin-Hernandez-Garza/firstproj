                <p id="aboutme">Always being fascinated by new technologies available and how they work. One day I happen to stumble upon a video on YouTube giving me tutorial on how to build a "Rock, Paper, and Scissors" game using Javascript, it automatically caught my eye for the fact that I like to build to things from scratch. I pressed play and ended up watching the video in it's entirety and I absolutely enjoyed it. That's when I decided to look up more videos about programming. After researching the different career paths that one could take I decided that Web Dev would be something that I would like to look into. And so I went ahead and bought a book set by Jon Duckett teaching me how to build websites using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. Having that said I am deciding to self-teach myself as much as I can about building websites from scratch using the following technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript) then my goal is to attend the University of Texas @ Austin's Coding Bootcamp cohort which would last around 6 months while attending part-time. As long as I an willing to do the work and study my "butt off" I know I can accomplish my goal of becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer.
